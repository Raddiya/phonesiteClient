              is very gentle and told me excatly what he was doing and was very attentive to my
              needs.</p>
              <p className="card-text">Usually used for the treatment of adolescent patients who will require a more permanent design once they are fully grown. The lifespan of a composite veneer is approximately 4 years. In contrast, a porcelain veneer may only be indirectly fabricated. A full veneer crown is described as â€œa restoration that covers all the coronal tooth surfaces. Laminate veneer, on the other hand, is a thin layer that covers only the surface of the tooth and is generally used for aesthetic purposes. These typically have better performance and aesthetics and are less plaque retentive.</p>
